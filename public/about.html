    Man! I'm really glad that you came in my 'about' page. But sadly, these pages are pretty much empty. Because I don't wanna waste my time on these pages which will gain me nothing. I got more important things to do. This is a hobby project. Node.js is currently on play.

    I'm actually a backend engineer who loves working with 'Backend' stuffs. But I really appreciate you coming here and wasting your time. THANKS!!!
